'''Bio.Phylo is written as a sub-package within the Biopython code base,
and is installed along with the Biopython distribution. It has been available 
as part of the Biopython library since version 1.54, released in May 2010.

The library can be used in Python versions 3.1 or later,
without any external libraries required at the time of installation. Functions
that rely on external libraries are written within a separate module of the code base,
and import their dependencies at run-time. This design makes it possible to install Biopython 
and use the rest of Bio.Phylo without having installed the dependencies for these specific functions.
Because Bio.Phylo is written entirely in Python, it also runs on alternative implementations of Python:
Jython 2.5 and Pypy 1.6 through 1.9 in particular pass the moduleâ€™s unit testing suite.'''
