'''Bio.Phylo is written as a sub-package within the Biopython code base,
and is installed along with the Biopython distribution. It has been available 
as part of the Biopython library since version 1.54, released in May 2010.

The library can be used in Python versions 3.1 or later,
without any external libraries required at the time of installation. Functions
that rely on external libraries are written within a separate module of the code base,
and import their dependencies at run-time. This design makes it possible to install Biopython 
and use the rest of Bio.Phylo without having installed the dependencies for these specific functions.
Because Bio.Phylo is written entirely in Python, it also runs on alternative implementations of Python:
Jython 2.5 and Pypy 1.6 through 1.9 in particular pass the moduleâ€™s unit testing suite.'''

"""for a try"""
#Make sure you have installed ete3 otherwise run these bash script "conda install -c etetoolkit ete3"
#first you create a file with newick format
#newick format uses nested parentheses to represent hierarchical data structures as text strings

from ete3 import Tree
string = '((((H,K),(F,I)G),E),((L,(N,Q)O),(P,S)));'
t = Tree(string, format=1)
t.write(format=1, outfile="new_tree.nw")

#After writting newick format file you then run it using the following codes
#to get an output as picture file you use these code : >>>Phylo.draw(tree)
from Bio import Phylo
tree = Phylo.read("new_tree.nw", "newick")
Phylo.draw_ascii(tree)



#to use this these codes you need first to upload a file containing scientific names of the pathogens separated by commas
#to do this you have a link "https://phylot.biobyte.de/" that will help you to create a new file with NEWICK or NEXUS format
#basically Phylot generates phylogenetic trees based on the NCBI taxonomy. From a list of taxonomic names, 
#identifiers or protein accessions, phyloT will generate a pruned tree in the selected output format. 
#Complete clades can be simply included, with interruption at desired taxonomic levels and 
#with optional filtering of unwanted nodes

#THEN YOU CAN DOWNLOAD NEWICK FORMAT FILE e.g: phyloT_generated_tree_NNNNNNNNN_newick
downloaded_file_from_Phylot = "phyloT_generated_tree_NNNNNNNNN_newick"
from Bio import Phylo
filename = downloaded_file_from_Phylot
tree = Phylo.read(filename, "newick")
Phylo.draw(tree)

#This will give out a phylogenetics picture of all organism listed in the uploaded file
