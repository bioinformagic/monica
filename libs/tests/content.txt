All test for libraries will be stored here.

QUICK RECAP ON HOW TO WRITE TESTS:
Unittest is automated so to look for exclusively files with the pattern test_* SO MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT if you want your test to work properly.

For each test, declare a Class and inherit it from unittest.TestCase. Each function that will serve as test needs to have the pattern test_*.

Apply DRY philosophy to your testing code as it will make debugging and changes a bit more comfy.

Test everything. Literally, everything that comes to your mind.
